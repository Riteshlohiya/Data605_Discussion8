#                             Discussion 8

#           Sums of Independent Random Variables

I will be attempting the below:

Exercise 3.

Let X1 and X2 be independent random variables with common distribution Px = 0 (1/8), 1 (3/8), 2 (1/2). Find the distribution of the sum X1 + X2.

Solution:

Let z = X1 + X2

P(z = 0)

```{r}
P0 <- 1/8*1/8 
P0
```

P(z = 1)

```{r}
P1 <- 1/8*3/8 + 3/8*1/8 
P1
```

P(z = 2)

```{r}
P2 <- 1/8*1/2 + 3/8*3/8 + 1/2*1/8 
P2
```

P(z = 3)

```{r}
P3 <- 3/8*1/2 + 1/2*3/8
P3
```

P(z = 4)

```{r}
P4 <- 1/2*1/2
P4
```

```{r}
print(c(P0, P1 ,P2 ,P3 ,P4))
```
